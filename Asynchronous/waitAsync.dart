/*
The async and await keywords both provide a declarative way to define an asynchronous function and use their results. 
You can use the async keyword before a function body to make it asynchronous. 
You can use the await keyword to get the completed result of an asynchronous expression.

Important Concept
  To define an Asynchronous function, add async before the function body.
  The await keyword work only in the async function.


You can handle errors in the dart async function by using try-catch. 
You can write try-catch code the same way you write synchronous code.

main() {

//Note: We cannot perform an asynchronous operation from a synchronous function.

/*
async The async keyword can be used before a functionâ€™s body to indicate that a function is asynchronous.
async function Functions marked with the async keyword are known as async functions.
await The completed output of an asynchronous expression can be retrieved with the await keyword. Only async functions can use the await keyword.
