/*
In Dart, boolean holds either true or false value. 
You can write the bool keyword to define the boolean data type. 
You can use boolean if the answer is true or false. 
Consider the answer to the following questions:
      Are you married?
      Is the door open?
      Does a cat fly?
      Is the traffic light green?
      Are you older than your father?
These all are yes/no questions. Its a good idea to store them in boolean.

void main() {
  bool isMarried = true;
  print('khaled marriage status $isMarried');
}
