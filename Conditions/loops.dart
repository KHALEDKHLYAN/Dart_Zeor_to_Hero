/*
Note: The primary purpose of all loops is to repeat a block of code.
In Programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code until certain conditions are not completed. 
For, e.g., if you want to print your name 100 times, then rather than typing print(“your name”); 100 times, you can use a loop.
      There are different types of loop in Dart. They are:
          For Loop
          For Each Loop
          While Loop
          Do While Loop

void main() {
  for (int i = 1; i < 100; i++) {
    print("$i John Doe");
  }
}
