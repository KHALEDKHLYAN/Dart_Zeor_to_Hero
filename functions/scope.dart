/*
        Scope In Dart
The scope is a concept that refers to where values can be accessed or referenced. 
Dart uses curly braces {} to determine the scope of variables. 
If you define a variable inside curly braces, you canâ€™t use it outside the curly braces.

Method Scope
If you created variables inside the method, you can use them inside the method block but not outside the method block.
*/

//Method scope
//In this program, text is a String type where you can access and print method only inside the main function but not outside the main function.
// void main() {
//   String text = "I am text inside main. Anyone can't access me.";
//   print(text);
// }

/*
Global Scope
You can define a variable in the global scope to use the variable anywhere in your program.
*/

String carName = "Hillax Toyotta";

void main() {
  print("This is the Best Car I know right now $carName");
}

/*
Lexical Scope
Dart is lexically scoped language, which means you can find the scope of variables with the help of braces {}.
