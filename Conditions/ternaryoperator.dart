/*
Ternary Operator
The ternary operator is like if-else statement. 
This is a one-liner replacement for the if-else statement. 
It is used to write a conditional expression, where based on the result of a boolean condition, one of the two values is selected.
Syntax:
  condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
Note: The ternary operator takes a condition and returns one of two values, depending upon the conditionâ€™s boolean value, i.e., true or false.
