/*
In object-oriented programming, an object is a self-contained unit of code and data. 
Objects are created from templates called classes. 
An object is made up of properties(variables) and methods(functions).
An object is an instance of a class.

For example, a bicycle object might have attributes like color, size, and current speed. 
It might have methods like changeGear, pedalFaster, and brake.

Note: To create an object, you must create a class first. Itâ€™s a good practice to declare the object name in lower case.

Instantiation
In object-oriented programming, instantiation is the process of creating an instance of a class. 
In other words, you can say that instantiation is the process of creating an object of a class. 
For example, if you have a class called Bicycle, then you can create an object of the class called bicycle.

                ClassName objectName = ClassName();
