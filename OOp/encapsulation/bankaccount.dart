/*
When To Use Getter And Setter
Use getter and setter when you want to restrict the access to the properties.
Use getter and setter when you want to perform some action before reading or writing the properties.
Use getter and setter when you want to validate the data before reading or writing the properties.
Donâ€™t use getter and setter when you want to make the properties read-only or write-only.
